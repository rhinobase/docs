## Introduction

[hono-rate-limiter](https://npmjs.com/package/hono-rate-limiter) is a rate limiting middleware for [Hono](https://hono.dev/). It helps protect your application from abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specified time window.

Rate limiting is essential for:

- Preventing API abuse and DDoS attacks
- Ensuring fair usage across all clients
- Protecting server resources
- Complying with API usage policies

## Installation

You can install the `hono-rate-limiter` package using your preferred package manager.

```package-install
hono-rate-limiter
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a minimal example to get started with rate limiting:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { rateLimiter } from "hono-rate-limiter";

const app = new Hono();

// Apply rate limiting middleware
app.use(
  rateLimiter({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    limit: 100, // Limit each client to 100 requests per window
    keyGenerator: (c) => c.req.header("x-forwarded-for") ?? "", // Use IP address as key
  })
);

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello Hono!"));

export default app;
```

This configuration limits each client to 100 requests per 15-minute window. When a client exceeds the limit, they receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Understanding the Configuration

The three essential options are:

- **`windowMs`**: The time window in milliseconds for tracking requests (e.g., 15 minutes)
- **`limit`**: Maximum number of requests allowed per window
- **`keyGenerator`**: A function that returns a unique identifier for each client

<Callout title="Important">
The `keyGenerator` function is required. It determines how clients are identified for rate limiting purposes. Common choices include IP addresses, API keys, or user IDs.
</Callout>

## Rate Limit Headers

By default, `hono-rate-limiter` sets standard rate limit headers on responses:

- `RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current window
- `RateLimit-Reset`: The time (in seconds) until the rate limit resets
- `RateLimit-Policy`: The rate limit policy

These headers follow the [IETF Rate Limit Headers specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-06) (draft-6 by default).
