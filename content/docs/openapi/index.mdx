## Introduction

[hono-openapi](https://npmjs.com/package/hono-openapi) is a library that makes it easy to generate OpenAPI specifications for your [Honojs](https://hono.dev/) app. It uses your validation schemas and middlewares to create comprehensive API documentation. This package is designed to work seamlessly with all the validation libraries which supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/).

It uses `@standard-community/standard-json` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@standard-community/standard-json)) and `@standard-community/standard-openapi` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@standard-community/standard-openapi)) under the hood to generate OpenAPI specifications.

## Installation

You can install the `hono-openapi` package using your preferred package manager.

```package-install
hono-openapi @hono/standard-validator
```

By default, internal packages such as `@standard-community/standard-json` and `@standard-community/standard-openapi` are installed as peer dependencies. If automatic installation of peer dependencies is disabled, you will need to install them manually.

```package-install
@hono/standard-validator @standard-community/standard-json @standard-community/standard-openapi
```

For a more complete TypeScript development experience, you may also consider installing the type packages as well.

```package-install
@types/json-schema openapi-types
```

Few validation libraries require additional dependencies to work with `hono-openapi`.
