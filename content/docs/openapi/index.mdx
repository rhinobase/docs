## Introduction

[hono-openapi](https://npmjs.com/package/hono-openapi) is a library that makes it easy to generate OpenAPI specifications for your [Honojs](https://hono.dev/) app. It uses your validation schemas and middlewares to create comprehensive API documentation. This package is designed to work seamlessly with all the validation libraries which supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/).

It uses [@standard-community/standard-json](https://npmjs.com/package/@standard-community/standard-json) and [@standard-community/standard-openapi](https://npmjs.com/package/@standard-community/standard-openapi) under the hood to generate OpenAPI specifications.
