## Define Validation Schemas

First, you need to define your validation schemas using Valibot. Below is an example of how to define schemas for query parameters and response body.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

// Validation for query parameters, eg - `/hello?name=John`
const querySchema = v.object({
    name: v.optional(v.string()),
});

// Validation for response body, eg - `"Hello, John!"`
const responseSchema = v.string();
```

These schemas will be used to generate the OpenAPI specifications for your Incoming requests and Outgoing responses.

## Updating the Router

Code below shows how you might be using Valibot with Hono for validation.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { vValidator } from "@hono/valibot-validator";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", vValidator("query", querySchema), (c) => {
  const query = c.req.valid("query");
  return c.text(`Hello ${query?.name ?? "Hono"}!`);
});
```

Now, follow the steps below to integrate Hono OpenAPI -

1. Inplace of importing the validation middleware (`vValidator`), from `@hono/valibot-validator`, import it from `hono-openapi`.
2. For describing the response body or adding information about the route, import `describeRoute` from `hono-openapi`. If you will be defining the response body using Valibot, you will also need to import `resolver` from `hono-openapi`.
3. You can uninstall `@hono/valibot-validator` as it is no longer needed.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import {
  validator as vValidator,
  resolver,
  describeRoute,
} from "hono-openapi";

const app = new Hono();

app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    responses: {
      200: {
        description: "Successful response",
        content: {
          "application/json": {
            schema: resolver(responseSchema),
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  vValidator("query", querySchema),
  (c) => {
    const query = c.req.valid("query");
    return c.text(`Hello ${query?.name ?? "Hono"}!`);
  },
);
```

And that's it! You have successfully integrated Hono OpenAPI. Now you will have to do this for all the routes you want to document but there is a way to list all the routes, which we will cover in the [Generating the OpenAPI Spec](#generating-the-openapi-spec) section.

You can also pass json schema directly to the `responses.200.content["application/json"].schema` if you don't want to use `resolver` from `hono-openapi`. This is useful if you have a static schema that you want to use for the response body.

## Passing Reference

You can use the `metadata` function to pass the reference to the schema -

```ts
const schema = v.pipe(
  v.object({
    myString: v.string(),
    myUnion: v.union([v.number(), v.boolean()]),
  }),
  v.description("My neat object schema"),
  v.metadata({
    ref: "MyNeatObjectSchema",
  }),
);
```

## Adding typesense for response body

Simply just create your response schema and pass it in the `describeResponse` function. This will automatically provide typesense for the response body.

```ts
const successResponseSchema = v.object({
  message: v.string(),
});

const errorResponseSchema = v.object({
  error: v.string(),
});

app.get(
  "/",
  describeResponse(
    (c) => {
      return c.json({ message: "Hello Hono!" }, 200);
    },
    {
      200: {
        description: "Success",
        content: {
          "application/json": {
            vSchema: successResponseSchema,
          },
        },
      },
      400: {
        description: "Error",
        content: {
          "application/json": {
            vSchema: errorResponseSchema,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ),
);
```

## Generating the OpenAPI Spec

For serving the OpenAPI spec, you can use the `openAPIRouteHandler` from `hono-openapi`. This will automatically generate the OpenAPI spec based on the routes you have defined in your Hono app.

In the example below, we will be serving the OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { openAPIRouteHandler } from "hono-openapi";

// Other hono apps
import routes from "./routes";

const main = new Hono();

main.get(
  "/openapi.json",
  openAPIRouteHandler(routes, {
    documentation: {
      info: {
        title: "Hono",
        version: "1.0.0",
        description: "API for greeting users",
      },
    },
  }),
);
```

Navigate to `/openapi.json` to see the generated OpenAPI spec. You can also use tools like [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) or Swagger UI to visualize the OpenAPI spec. Check out the [OpenAPI documentation](/docs/openapi/ui) for more details on how to use these tools.

For quick testing, you can also pass `includeEmptyPaths: true` to the `openAPIRouteHandler` options. This will include all the routes in the hono app, even if they don't have any OpenAPI documentation. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.
