## Hide Routes

You can conditionally hide routes from the OpenAPI specification by using the `hide` property in the `describeRoute` function. This is useful when you want to hide certain routes in production or based on some environment variable.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    // ...
    hide: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
  (c) => {
    return c.text("Private Route");
  }
);
```

You can also pass a function to the `hide` property which will be called with the context object.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    hide: ({ c, path, method }) => c.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
);
```

<Callout title="Note">
The `c` object is the context object which you passed in `openAPIRouteHandler` or `generateSpecs` function. The `path` and `method` properties are the path and method of the current route. This is useful when you want to globally declare the function to hide routes.
</Callout>

## OperationId

Out of the box, the `describeRoute` function will generate a unique operationId for each route. This is useful for generating the OpenAPI specification. However, in some cases, you might want to manually set the operationId for a route. You can do this by passing the `operationId` property to the `describeRoute` function.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    operationId: "getHello",
  }),
);
```

You can also pass a function to the `operationId` property which will be called with the route object.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    operationId: (route) => `${route.method}-${route.path}`,
  }),
);
```

## Vendor Loading

In v1, we added support for `loadVendor` function, which you can use for -

1. Loading other vendor libraries, which support Standard Schema
2. Implement custom parsing/processing logic for supported vendors

```ts
import { loadVendor } from "hono-openapi";
import zodOpenApiHandler from "@standard-community/standard-openapi/zod";

loadVendor("zod", {
  toOpenAPISchema: zodOpenApiHandler(),
});
```

The vendor name used here comes from the Standard Schema library's vendor name, which you can find by `'schema["~standard"].vendor'` where `schema` is the Standard Schema library's schema object.

As the `hono-openapi` uses `@standard-community/standard-openapi` and `@standard-community/standard-json` under the hood, they expose the currently used functions for transforming the schemas. You can use them and either create a wrapper function or create one from scratch.
